# Platform Strategies – Core Concepts

| Dimension | Key Focus | Main Elements | Strategic Implications |
|---------|----------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Platform Definition** | Multi-sided interaction | Enables interaction or transactions between two or more distinct customer groups | Value depends on participation of multiple sides rather than unilateral consumption |
| **Value Creation** | Searching & Matching | Centralized (algorithmic) or decentralized (user-driven) matching | Efficiency and quality of matches directly affect user retention |
|  | Pricing & Payments | Platform-set prices, seller-set prices, auctions, or bilateral bargaining | Pricing structure shapes incentives, adoption, and friction |
|  | Trust Mechanisms | Screening, ratings/reviews, identity checks, insurance and protection mechanisms | Trust reduces transaction risk and supports scale |
|  | Network Effects | Cross-side, same-side, and data-driven effects | Growth on one side increases value for others, reinforcing dominance |
| **Value Capture** | Pricing Strategy | Who pays, who is subsidized, when charges occur | Determines sustainability and competitive positioning |
|  | Winner-Takes-All Dynamics | Strong network effects and high switching costs | Markets tend toward concentration or dominance |
|  | Economies of Scale & Scope | Large fixed investments spread across growing user base | Favors large incumbents and rapid expansion |
|  | Envelopment | Expansion into adjacent markets using existing capabilities | Defensive and offensive growth strategy |
| **Product → Platform Transition** | Preconditions | Defensible core product and critical mass of users | Without these, platform launch is unlikely to succeed |
|  | Business Model Options | Hybrid, “more of the same”, or fundamentally new platform | Trade-off between control, investment, and ecosystem growth |
|  | Transition Management | Rapid user conversion, brand consistency, cultural change | Requires organizational and strategic realignment |
|  | Governance | Control of third-party participation and scope | Prevents platform erosion and competitive hijacking |
| **Antitrust Concerns** | Market Power | Self-preferencing, exclusive agreements, data leverage | Can disadvantage complementors and rivals |
|  | Lock-in Mechanisms | High switching costs and network effects | Reduce competition and user mobility |
|  | Competitive Impact | Acquisition of potential competitors, restricted access | Regulatory scrutiny due to reduced innovation and higher costs |
