# IoT and Service Business Models – Essential Knowledge Summary

## Services and Service Logic Foundations

### Definition of Services
Services are economic activities in which one party applies time-based performances to create desired outcomes for another party or for assets owned by the customer. Customers gain value from access to skills, labor, systems, networks, and facilities, without taking ownership of physical assets.

### Service-Dominant Logic
Service is the fundamental basis of exchange. All businesses are service businesses, and all products are appliances for service provision.  
Key principles:
- Value is co-created with the customer, not delivered unilaterally.
- Customers are always co-creators of value.
- All economic actors integrate resources.
- Value is uniquely determined by the beneficiary in use and context.

### Value Co-Creation
Organizations cannot pre-produce value. They can only propose value propositions, which customers realize through the integration of resources across networks of actors (private, public, and market-facing).

## Service Systems and Innovation

### Service Systems
Service systems are configurations of people, technology, and other resources that interact with other systems to co-create value.

### Service Innovation
Service innovation involves creating new or improved service offerings, service processes, or service business models.

### Service Logic Innovation
Innovation occurs when customer thinking, participation, and capabilities for value creation change. Innovation focuses on redefining how customers perceive and use value, not only on production efficiency.

### Business Model Innovation
Business model innovation requires systematic reconfiguration of resources and ecosystem partners to design new or improved value propositions.

## Internet of Things (IoT): Technologies and Layers

### IoT Technology Layers
1. **Endpoints**: Sensors and actuators that monitor and affect the physical world.
2. **Simple hubs**: Devices connecting endpoints to networks.
3. **Integrating hubs**: Complex systems combining multiple hubs and services.
4. **Network and cloud services**: Connectivity, data storage, processing, and analytics infrastructure.
5. **Enhanced services**: Advanced services built by integrating data across multiple hubs and platforms.

## IoT-Based Business Models

### IoT Ecosystem Roles
- **Enablers**: Technology-oriented firms building IoT infrastructure (devices, connectivity, platforms, cloud, and software).
- **Engagers**: Firms connecting IoT capabilities to customers through human-centered service design.
- **Enhancers**: Firms creating new value by integrating and reframing IoT-enabled services and data.

## Digital Servitization

### Definition
Digital servitization is the transition from selling standalone products to delivering smart product–service–software systems enabled by IoT, data, analytics, monitoring, control, optimization, and autonomous functionality.

### Product–Service Systems (PSS)
Product–service systems shift value from pure product ownership toward service-based value creation:
- Product-oriented services (e.g., maintenance and repair)
- Use-oriented services (e.g., leasing, renting, sharing)
- Result-oriented services (e.g., functional outcomes and performance management)

## Types of Digital Servitization Business Models

### Product-Oriented Service Provider
- Sells products with add-on services.
- Pricing based on units sold.
- Limited impact of digital diagnostics on pricing.
- Low switching costs and customer power often high.

### Industrializer
- Emphasizes modularity in products and services.
- Balances efficiency with customization.
- Focuses on scalable delivery through modular design.

### Customized Integrated Solution Provider
- Delivers highly customized integrated product–service solutions.
- Relies on advanced monitoring, diagnostics, analytics, and optimization.
- Requires deep integration with customer and partner systems.

### Outcome Provider
- Sells outcomes instead of products or services.
- Retains ownership of assets.
- Revenue depends on measured performance improvements.
- Requires continuous monitoring, control, and optimization.
- Strong ecosystem collaboration is essential.

### Platform Provider
- Operates a digital platform connecting multiple providers and customers.
- Enables data sharing, monitoring, control, and optimization at scale.
- Strong power position due to control over usage data and interactions.

## Energy Service Business Models (Illustrative Domain)

### Main Models
- **Energy Supply Contract**: Selling useful energy (e.g., heat) instead of fuel.
- **Energy Service Financing**: Financing energy systems while customers retain ownership.
- **Energy Performance Contract (EPC)**: Guaranteeing measured energy savings.
- **Energy Service Agreement (ESA)**: EPC with integrated financing and long-term guarantees.
- **Energy as a Service (EaaS)**: Bundling energy supply and services into a single service payment (e.g., comfort-based pricing).

## Transformation of Manufacturing Firms

### Traditional Manufacturing Model
- Revenue from equipment sales and ownership transfer.
- Transaction-based relationships.
- Limited customer interaction and operational visibility.
- Services treated as add-ons.

### Outcome-Based and Service-Based Model
- Continuous interaction via IoT devices.
- Revenue linked to outcomes and performance improvements.
- Deep, long-term partnerships with customers.
- Data-driven optimization, predictive analytics, and ecosystem collaboration.
- Transition from asset sales to value-in-use and performance-based pricing.

## Key Takeaway
IoT-enabled service business models shift firms from selling products to orchestrating value co-creation through services, data, platforms, and ecosystems. Competitive advantage increasingly depends on digital capabilities, customer integration, and outcome-based value propositions rather than ownership of physical assets.
